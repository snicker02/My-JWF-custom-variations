My JWF custom variations

These are just some of my custom variations for JWildfire. Some are pretty stable but some are not so use at your own risk. There is no implied warranty of use. But feel free to use them and I would love to see what you make with them. 

You can use these by going to the custom_wf_full variaiton, hit the "gear" icon and paste the code into the box that opens. Then use just like you would a regular variation. 

Variations under the AI assisted folder were ones that I had ideas for variations and used AI to help in the making of the variations.
