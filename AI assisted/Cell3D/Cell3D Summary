Okay, we've taken the original Cell2Func through a significant evolution, culminating in the highly parameterized Cell3D_Func. Here's a summary of the major changes and additions made across these iterations:

I. Foundational Changes (From Cell2Func to Cell2_PlusFunc conceptual stage):

Consistent size and a Logic:
The parameter a was re-purposed to be a consistent divisor for size.
actual_cell_size = size / a is now used uniformly for calculating cell indices, intra-cell coordinates (dx, dy), and reconstructing cell positions. This provides more intuitive control over cell dimensions.
Safeguards were added for a or size being near zero.
Initial 2D Cell Content Transformations:
Scaling: cell_scale_x, cell_scale_y to scale content within each 2D cell.
Power Distortion: cell_power_x, cell_power_y to apply a power function to normalized intra-cell coordinates, altering their distribution.
Rotation: cell_rotate (2D) to rotate content around the center of each 2D cell.
Final 2D Offset:
offset_x, offset_y to shift the entire pattern after all other calculations.
II. Enhanced 2D Grid Control (From Cell2_PlusFunc to Cell2_SuperFunc conceptual stage):

2D Grid Rotation:
grid_rotate parameter added to rotate the entire input coordinate system before cell indexing, effectively rotating the whole grid structure.
Intra-Cell Coordinate Mode (dxdy_mode):
Introduced a mode to change how dx, dy (the coordinates within a cell) are interpreted:
0: Linear (original direct offset).
1: Folded/Mirrored (creates a triangular wave/mirroring effect within the cell).
Symmetrical move_ Parameters for 2D Quadrants:
The original cell2 had an asymmetric set of move_ parameters for shifting cells based on their quadrant.
New parameters move_tr_x, move_tr_y (for Top-Right quadrant) and move_br_x (for Bottom-Right X-axis) were added to provide more complete and symmetrical control over cell grid displacement.
III. Coloring Capabilities (From Cell2_SuperFunc to Cell2_UltimateFunc conceptual stage):

color_mode Parameter:
A master switch to enable different coloring algorithms (0 = default JWildfire coloring).
Coloring Based on Cell Index (Mode 1):
Color derived from the 2D cell indices (original_x_idx, original_y_idx).
Parameters: cidx_scale_x, cidx_scale_y, cidx_offset.
Coloring Based on Intra-Cell Distance (Mode 2):
Color based on the magnitude of (dx, dy) from the cell's origin (after dxdy_mode but before other content transforms).
Parameter: cdist_scale.
Coloring Based on Quadrant (Mode 3):
Assigns one of four predefined colors based on the XY quadrant of the original raw cell index.
Parameters: color_q1, color_q2, color_q3, color_q4.
Helper: normalizeColor() function to keep color values in the [0,1) range.
IV. Advanced 2D Grid Patterning (From Cell2_UltimateFunc to Cell2_HyperFunc conceptual stage):

Checkerboard Application of Space/Move Parameters:
checkerboard_mode: Enables alternating between two full sets of space_ and move_ parameters for cells arranged in a checkerboard pattern (based on (original_x_idx_raw + original_y_idx_raw) % 2).
checkerboard_invert: Flips the checkerboard pattern.
Alternate Set of Space/Move Parameters: A complete duplicate set of all 2D space_ and move_ parameters (e.g., space_xa2, move_tr_x2, etc.) for the alternate cells.
Cell Index Power Distortion (2D):
cell_idx_power_x, cell_idx_power_y: Applies a power function to the raw cell indices (original_x_idx_raw, original_y_idx_raw) before they are used in the quadrant logic for spacing/movement. This allows for non-linear distortion of the overall cell grid.
V. Full Conversion to 3D (Becoming Cell3D_Func):

Variation Type: Changed to VARTYPE_3D. The function now inherently processes and produces 3D coordinates.
3D Input Processing:
Grid Rotation: Extended to 3D using Euler angles: grid_rot_x, grid_rot_y, grid_rot_z.
actual_cell_size applied uniformly to X, Y, and Z dimensions.
3D Cell Indexing & Intra-Cell Coordinates:
Calculates original_x_idx_raw, original_y_idx_raw, original_z_idx_raw.
Calculates dx, dy, dz (intra-cell offsets).
dxdy_mode became dxdydz_mode, affecting Z as well if "Folded".
3D Cell Content Transformations:
Scaling: Added cell_scale_z.
Power: Added cell_power_z.
Rotation: Extended to 3D Euler angles cell_rot_x, cell_rot_y, cell_rot_z for rotating (dx,dy,dz) around the cell center.
3D Cell Index Manipulation:
Cell Index Power: Added cell_idx_power_z for original_z_idx_raw.
XY Plane Logic: The existing 2D quadrant logic (with primary and alternate checkerboard parameters) continues to determine modified_x_idx and modified_y_idx.
Z Plane Logic: Independent control for modified_z_idx using:
space_z, move_z (primary).
space_z2, move_z2 (alternate for checkerboard mode).
Final Output Calculation:
Calculates final_x, final_y, final_z.
Added invert_y_output (default 1, like original cell2) and invert_z_output (default 0) to control negation of Y and Z contributions.
3D Mirroring and Offset:
Added mirror_z parameter.
Added offset_z parameter.
3D Coloring Options:
Mode 1 (Cell Index): Now includes processed_original_z_idx. Added cidx_scale_z.
Mode 2 (Intra-Cell Distance): Uses sqrt(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2), normalized by actual_cell_size * sqrt(3.0).
Mode 3 (Octant Influence): XY Quadrant colors can now be modulated by the sign of original_z_idx_raw using color_use_z_sign and color_z_neg_offset.
Mode 4 (Z-Index Based Color): New mode, color based purely on original_z_idx_raw using cz_scale and cz_offset.
Helper Function: Added rotatePoint3D for applying 3D Euler angle rotations.
Name: Final name Cell3D_Func with getName() returning "cell3D".
This journey has transformed a relatively simple 2D cellular variation into an exceptionally versatile 3D generator with a very extensive set of parameters for deep creative exploration.
