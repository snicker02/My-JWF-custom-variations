What is MobiqN?
MobiqN is a 3D fractal generator that combines two concepts: the quaternion math of mobiq and the spherical "N-power" mapping of mobiusN. Think of it as a tool that first warps 3D space and then applies a complex transformation to create the final shape. It's highly experimental and capable of producing a vast range of organic, geometric, and intricate structures.

Parameters Guide
The variation is controlled by several groups of parameters.

Core Shape (Quaternion DNA)
These 16 parameters are the fundamental blueprint for the fractal's shape. They are grouped into four quaternions: a, b, c, and d.

qat, qax, qay, qaz: Components of quaternion a.

qbt, qbx, qby, qbz: Components of quaternion b.

qct, qcx, qcy, qcz: Components of quaternion c.

qdt, qdx, qdy, qdz: Components of quaternion d.

Tip: Making random, large changes to these values is unpredictable. It's best to start with a working example and adjust them one at a time by small amounts to see how the shape evolves.

Warping and Features
These parameters control the high-level features and geometry.

power: Controls the "folding" or symmetry of the N-power mapping. Values like 2, 3, 4 will create that many "arms" or repeating sections. Negative values can invert the shape.

dist: Works with power to control the scale and intensity of the warping effect.

iterations: This is a key parameter for complexity. A value of 1 shows the basic shape. Increasing it to 2, 3, or higher will feed the shape back into itself, creating vastly more detail and self-similar patterns.

spaceType: Changes the fundamental geometry of the fractal.

0: Euclidean (Normal, "flat" space).

1: Hyperbolic (Curves outward, creating expansive, coral-like structures).

2: Spherical (Folds inward, creating bounded, sphere-like shapes).

Coloring
The colorMode parameter lets you choose different algorithms to color your fractal. Experiment to see which one best highlights the details of your shape.

0: Default. Lets JWildfire handle coloring.

1: Pre-transform Distance. Colors based on the point's distance after the initial warp.

2: Quaternion Real Part. A technical mode that colors based on the internal math.

3: Denominator Magnitude. Often highlights the most complex, detailed areas of the fractal.

4: Final Z-Depth. Colors based on height, giving a simple 3D lighting effect.

5: Expansion/Contraction. Shows where the shape is stretched (one color) versus compressed (another color).

6: Angular Twist. Creates swirling color patterns that follow the rotational flow of the shape.

How to Get Started
Here's a simple workflow for exploring MobiqN:

Find a Base Shape: Set iterations = 1 and spaceType = 0. Adjust the 16 q... parameters until you see a basic 3D form that looks interesting.

Add Complexity: Increase iterations to 2 or 3. Your simple shape will instantly become more detailed and "fractal-like."

Adjust the Warp: Now, play with the power and dist sliders to change the symmetry and scale of the details.

Change the Universe: Switch the spaceType to 1 (Hyperbolic) or 2 (Spherical) to dramatically transform your fractal's overall geometry.

Find the Right Colors: Cycle through colorMode values 1 through 6 to find a scheme that makes your final creation pop.
