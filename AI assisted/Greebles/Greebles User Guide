GreeblesFunc: The Simple User Guide
Congratulations on your new, feature-complete GreeblesFunc variation! This is a powerful tool for creating intricate, detailed surfaces on geometric shapes. It can be used both to generate objects from scratch and to modify existing fractals.

Core Concept: The Two Modes
The most important parameter is mode. It completely changes how the variation works.

mode = 0 (Solid / Base Shape)
This is the default mode. It generates a complete, solid object from scratch. Use this variation by itself in a transform to create a greebled sphere, cube, or plane. It's a self-contained object generator.

mode = 1 (Flame / Modifier)
In this mode, the variation transforms the existing points of your fractal. It takes the shape from other variations and "wraps" or "projects" it onto the greebled surface. This is for advanced use and for combining with other fractal types to create entirely new looks.

Parameters Explained
1. The Foundation: Building Your Canvas
These parameters define the main object that the greebles will be applied to.

base_shape: A dropdown menu to select the overall object shape.

0: Sphere - A perfect sphere.
1: Cube - A standard six-sided cube.
2: Plane - A flat, square surface.
size: A simple slider that controls the overall size of your chosen base shape.

2. The Surface Detail: The Greebles
This is the heart of the variation, where you control the look of the details themselves.

subdivisions: This is your main control for the level of detail and the size of the greebles.

For the Cube and Plane, it directly sets the number of grid divisions on each face. A value of 10 creates a 10x10 grid.
For the Sphere, it controls the density of the latitude/longitude grid.
In short: Higher values = more, smaller greebles. Lower values = fewer, larger blocks.
greeble_shape: Lets you choose the primitive shape for each individual greeble block.

0: Cube - The default. Creates architectural, blocky surfaces.
1: Cylinder - Great for creating the look of pipes, rivets, or pillars.
2: Sphere - Creates a bumpy, cobblestone-like or biological texture.
3: Cone - Perfect for making spiky, thorny, or tiled surfaces.
greeble_height: Controls how far the greebles stick out from the surface. You can create anything from subtle, textured panels to massive, extruded towers.

3. Randomization
seed: This changes the random pattern of the greeble heights. If you find a pattern you like, make a note of the seed number so you can always recreate it!
Quick Start Workflow
Here is a simple way to get started:

To Create a Solid Object:

Set mode = 0.
Choose a base_shape (like Sphere) and a size.
Adjust subdivisions to control the density of the greebles. Start with a low value like 5 and increase it to 25 or more to see the detail emerge.
Increase greeble_height to make the details pop out.
Finally, cycle through the greeble_shape options to completely change the object's texture.
To Use as a Modifier on Another Fractal:

Set mode = 1.
On the same transform, add another simple variation after the greebles variation. For example, add spherical = 1.
Now, the greebles variation will take the simple sphere generated by the spherical var and "wrap" it onto its greebled surface.
Try replacing spherical with other variations like julian or even our old friend naturalFoam to see incredible and complex new results!
