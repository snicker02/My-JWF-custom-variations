This variation creates 11 different Archimedean shapes for use in fractal flames. These are beautiful 3D geometric polyhedra with regular polygonal faces.

Parameters
type (0-10)
Selects which geometric shape to use:

0 = Cuboctahedron (cube meets octahedron)
1 = Truncated Octahedron (cut-corner octahedron)
2 = Truncated Cube (cut-corner cube)
3 = Rhombicuboctahedron (square-based rounded shape)
4 = Great Rhombicuboctahedron (large complex shape)
5 = Truncated Tetrahedron (cut-corner pyramid)
6 = Icosahedron (20-sided die shape)
7 = Rhombicosidodecahedron (complex rounded shape)
8 = Truncated Icosahedron (soccer ball)
9 = Icosidodecahedron (triangle-pentagon mix)
10 = Truncated Dodecahedron (cut-corner 12-sided)

scale (default: 1.0)
Controls the size of the shape.

Higher values = larger shape
Lower values = smaller shape
Try: 0.5 to 2.0

thickness (default: 0.05)
Controls the thickness of edges and lines in non-solid modes.

Higher values = thicker, more visible edges
Lower values = thinner, more delicate lines
Try: 0.01 to 0.2

internal_mode (0, 1, or 2)
Changes how the shape is rendered:

0 = Solid - Fills in the faces of the polyhedron (most common)
1 = Spokes - Shows lines from center to vertices (star-like)
2 = Web - Shows all edges connecting vertices (wireframe-like)

recursion_depth (default: 0)
Adds fractal-like detail by subdividing the shape.

0 = No subdivision (recommended for most uses)
1-3 = Adds increasingly complex detail
Higher values create more intricate patterns but slow down rendering

surface_lines (0 or 1)
Controls whether edges are drawn in non-solid modes:

0 = No surface edges shown
1 = Show surface edges (default)
Only affects modes 1 and 2 (Spokes/Web)


Quick Start Tips
For a basic solid shape:

type = 8 (soccer ball is always popular!)
scale = 1.0
internal_mode = 0 (solid)
Leave other parameters at defaults

For interesting wireframe effects:

type = 7 (complex shape)
internal_mode = 2 (web)
thickness = 0.1
scale = 1.5

For star-burst patterns:

type = 6 (icosahedron)
internal_mode = 1 (spokes)
thickness = 0.05
