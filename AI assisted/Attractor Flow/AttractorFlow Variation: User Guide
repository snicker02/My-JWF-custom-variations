AttractorFlow Variation: User Guide
The AttractorFlow variation is a powerful tool for creating a huge range of complex, abstract patterns. It works by combining different mathematical formulas (attractors) with various wave shapes.

Main Controls: The Modes
These three parameters have the biggest impact on the overall look of your fractal. Start by changing these first.

attractorMode: Selects the core mathematical engine.

0 = Clifford: Creates smooth, flowing, and often intricate web-like patterns.

1 = Peter de Jong: Produces organic, swirling, and sometimes chaotic shapes.

2 = Svensson: Generates sharp, geometric, and flame-like structures.

3 = Gumowski-Mira: Makes elegant, calligraphic patterns that look like distorted organisms.

waveMode: Changes the shape of the waves used in the formula.

0 = Sine: Smooth and organic. The default wave.

1 = Square: Hard-edged and blocky. Great for digital or circuit-like patterns.

2 = Triangle: Sharp and linear. Creates geometric, angular patterns.

3 = Sawtooth: Jagged and harsh. Produces unique repeating lines.

zMode: Controls how the fractal behaves in 3D space.

0 = Legacy 2D: The pattern is essentially 2D, with a simple effect applied to the Z-axis.

1 = Coupled 3D: A true 3D mode where the X, Y, and Z axes all influence each other to create complex three-dimensional shapes.

Primary Shape Controls
These parameters control the fundamental structure of the pattern. Small changes here can have big effects.

yScale & xScale: These control the "cross-axis" influence. For example, yScale determines how much the Y position affects the new X position.

xAmplitude & yAmplitude: These control the strength or size of the wave patterns on each axis.

3D-Specific Controls
These parameters only have an effect when zMode is set to 1 (Coupled 3D).

zScale & zAmplitude: These work just like their X/Y counterparts but control the shape and strength of the pattern along the Z-axis.

Fine-Tuning Controls
Use these parameters to make more subtle adjustments once you have a basic shape you like. (Note: These have the strongest effect on the Clifford attractor).

freqX & freqY: Adjust the frequency or "density" of the patterns. Higher values create more detail and repetition.

phaseX & phaseY: Shift or "offset" the patterns without changing their basic shape. This is great for fine-tuning the alignment.

Presets
The preset parameter is a shortcut to load interesting starting points.

0 = Custom: Allows for manual control of all sliders.

1 = Clifford Classic: The original flowing pattern.

2 = De Jong Circuits: A blocky pattern using the De Jong attractor and square waves.

3 = Svensson Flames: A sharp pattern using the Svensson attractor and triangle waves.

4 = 3D Warped Grid: A fully 3D Clifford pattern.

Important: Changing any other slider will automatically set preset back to 0, allowing you to use the presets as a starting point for your own creations.
